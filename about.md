##Ahoy there, I am Antonio Pavicevac-Ortiz!


I'd like to be the Leonard Lopate of Web Development and Design; What does that mean? Well, if you're a listener to the James Beard award winning [show](http://www.wnyc.org/shows/lopate/) on wnyc (93.9FM/820AM), you'd know how eclectic his shows topics are. Economics, Science, the Arts and current events are common place on his airwaves.   

<p>Going forward, my hope is to infuse my <a class="resume" title="My Resume"href="../assets/images/antonio-p-ortiz.pdf" target="_blank">career</a> with my interest in Graphic Design, Illustration and my insatiable interest in web development! Currently, I am a Front End Web Developer working at Avon Inc. in New York City!</p>    

<div class="message">My time is filled 'Hello Worlding' stuff. (e.g. HTML5, CSS, SASS, JS, AngularJS, Gulp, Ruby...)</div>

My hope with this blog is to cronicle my progression in the dev world, specifically in regards to learning new stuff while actually living life.
At the moment I am really focused on JavaScript.
